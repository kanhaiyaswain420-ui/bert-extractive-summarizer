C is a powerful and widely used programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. Often called the “mother of programming languages,” C has influenced many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python. It is a structured and procedural language, which means programs are organized into functions, and the main() function serves as the entry point of every program. C uses variables to store data, and each variable must have a specific data type such as int, float, char, or double. It supports arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and /, as well as relational operators like == and > for comparisons. Control statements such as if, else, and switch allow programs to make decisions, while loops like for, while, and do-while enable repetition of tasks. Arrays in C can store multiple items of the same type, and strings are arrays of characters ending with a null character '\0'. Pointers, which store memory addresses, make C very powerful and flexible but require careful handling. Functions help divide a program into smaller, manageable parts, and C supports both built-in and user-defined functions. Additionally, C provides strong support for file handling operations, allowing programs to read and write data. C programs are compiled using a compiler that converts the code into machine language, making execution fast and efficient. Its low-level memory access and speed make C ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance. Overall, C is a foundational language that helps programmers understand core programming concepts and serves as a stepping stone to learning other languages.
